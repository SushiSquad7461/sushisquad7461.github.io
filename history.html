          <h2>2019</h2>
          <p>2019 was our first year existing as a team — as a small community team of 16 students with very little mentorship we struggled a lot, but managed to pull through, winning the Rookie All-Star award at the District and District Championship levels, qualifying to the world championships in Houston.</p>

          <h2>2019 Offseason</h2>
          <p>The 2019 offseason was a huge rebuilding season — we used it to focus on improving our technical abilities, while also training over 20 new members. We built two offseason robots — shopping cart, which was our in season robot stripped down to just a drivetrain and a hatch mechanism, which made it to the semifinals at Peak Performance and Doggo, which made it to finals at Girls Generation and semifinals at Robot Rewind.

            <h2>2020</h2>
            <p>While our 2020 season was cut short due to the pandemic, 7461 built our best robot yet, making it to the semifinals at the Glacier Peak district event week 1.</p>

              In 2021, our season was virtual; however, we remained busy working on the infinite recharge home competition, and we made an entry for the innovation challenge. We also won the imagery award for our game design challenge submission.

              In the 2021 offseason, we gained many new members, and worked on improving our skills. We also participated in offseason events such as Bordie Recharge, and the PNW Block Party.

            <p>
              The 2022 season is looking like it will be our best season yet. We have gained a lot of knowledge over the past 3 years, and we hope our robot will reflect that.
