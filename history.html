          <h2>2019</h2>
          <p>2019 was our first year existing as a team — as a small community team of 16 students with very little mentorship we struggled a lot, but managed to pull through, winning the Rookie All-Star award at the District and District Championship levels, qualifying to the world championships in Houston.</p>

          <h2>2019 Offseason</h2>
          <p>The 2019 offseason was a huge rebuilding season — we used it to focus on improving our technical abilities, while also training over 20 new members. We built two offseason robots — shopping cart, which was our in season robot stripped down to just a drivetrain and a hatch mechanism, which made it to the semifinals at Peak Performance and Doggo, which made it to finals at Girls Generation and semifinals at Robot Rewind.

            <h2>2020</h2>
            <p>While our 2020 season was cut short due to the pandemic, 7461 built our best robot yet, making it to the semifinals at the Glacier Peak district event week 1.</p>
